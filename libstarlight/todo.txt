today's agenda {
    FSHelper, recursive directory assertion etc.
} then {
    change Label to move the rect instead of resizing to accomodate drops (add an offset thing to Font)
    figure out how I want to do separate forms???
    kill scroll velocity when hitting the edge (or rapid decel)
    make scrollfield autofit a flag
    make le scrollfield check threshold itself and only count directions it can actually scroll
    visual sugar such as "bump glow" for scrollfields
}

unordered_roadmap {
    moar UI elements {
        checkbox
        radio box
        tabs?
        auto-layout/list boxes
        text/combo box
        slider
        progress bar
        
    }
    maybe switch drawoffset system from a stack to a pass-in
    moar utility stuff in Vector2 and VRect {
        -
    }
    tween system
    figure out theme layout and fallback system
    maybe a few further refinements to bitmap fonts
    ...
    use ctrulib sync features for WorkerThread instead of spinlocks at some point
    - http://smealum.github.io/ctrulib/synchronization_8h.html#a9fe83ca3ec3c6ae269203acf367ad5a9
    duck l'orange
    
    ... tweenable drawable format?
    figure out the whole font y offset deal
}

theme layout {
    sdmc:/.starlight/themes/<name>/ {
        fonts {
            default.12.json/png/border.png
            default.16
            mono.12/16
        }
        controls {
            button.idle/pressed
            ...
        }
    }
}


drawable, drawcontext, gfxmanager (pushContext, popContext) (done mostly)
ThemeRef (done) {
    theme-asset-specific reference so themes can be reloaded
    -> operator overloaded etc.
}

configurator for ui elements? maybe crtp after all
noap, macro/include shenanigans
new Button().at(40, 40).within(container).ofSize(64, 32).withText("Popsicles!");
shelved for now because shared_from_this is kind of dumb for what I need it for :D :D :D
(though maybe some trickery with putting the last-created-element in a static, combined with static factory pattern...)

maybe LoosePtr (wraps weak_ptr for expired check but references by raw pointer)
implement this to replace weak_ptr parent if it ends up impacting performance too much

maybe implement this: https://probablydance.com/2013/01/13/a-faster-implementation-of-stdfunction/
